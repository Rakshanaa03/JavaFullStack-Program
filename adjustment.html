        On the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Insert</span> tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the overall look of your document. You can use these galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look. You can easily change the formatting of selected text in the document text by choosing a look for the selected text from the <span style="font-style: italic; color: white;">Quick Styles</span> gallery on the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">Home</span> tab. You can also format text directly by using the other controls on the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">Home</span> tab. Most controls offer a choice of using the look from the current theme or using a format that you specify directly. To change the overall look of your document, choose new <span style="font-style: italic; color: white;">Theme</span> elements on the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">Page Layout</span> tab. To change the looks available in the <span style="font-style: italic; color: white;">Quick Style</span> gallery, use the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">Change Current Quick Style Set</span> command. Both the <span style="font-style: italic; color: white;">Themes</span> gallery and the <span style="font-style: italic; color: white;">Quick Styles</span> gallery provide reset commands so that you can always restore the look of your document to the original contained in your current template. On the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">Insert</span> tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the overall look of your document. You can use these galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look.
